Date Night Planner

https://ut-group7.github.io/Group7Project/

This app is to help revolutionize the way we think about date night. It is meant to help us decide on what to eat or where to be at the right time. Who here has been stuck trying to decide where to dine with their significant other? Many of us have. It is natural for some of us to be indecisive and this app takes all the guess work out of it. You simply press a few links through to find your location and general interests, and you get a simple list of restaurants and events that peak your interest, based on your initial basic survey.


The way it was broken down was by the ticket master search and results, the yelp search and results, the login process, the map and the appearance. Then we worked on cleaning everything up after the base was in place.

Features weâ€™d like to have down the road is the ability to email a user their itinerary, doing more touch ups on the mobile view and add a countdown til when your event starts on your itinerary page. 

In the future we can likely make this app better by adding an update that featured specific suggestions using deeper user analysis based on searches and spending trends.
